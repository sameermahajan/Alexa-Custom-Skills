## Setup ASK CLI

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g ask-cli
ask init

```
ask api get-skill -s skill_id > skill.json
```

Edit the jason to add something like

```
    "events": {
      "publications": [
        {
          "eventName": "AMAZON.MessageAlert.Activated"
        },
        {
          "eventName": "AMAZON.SportsEvent.Updated"
        }
      ],
      "endpoint": {
        "uri": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:<id>:function:sameer_alexa_test"
      }
    },
```

to the "manifest" section.

Update the skill with the corrected manifest

```
ask api update-skill -s skill_id -f skill.json
```

Check skill status â€” if it is updated correct, status will contain SUCCESS

```
